    The Carbon Violence archive exposes the violent incidents <sup
      style="font-size: 10px;"
    >
      1</sup
    > that occur to individuals and communities living in areas where carbon offsetting
    projects are implemented, making accountable project developers, subsidiaries,
    investors, funders, validation and verification bodies, brokers, corporations
    purchasing credits.

  <p>
    The idea emerged following the publication of the Offset Archive <sup
      style="font-size: 10px;"
    >
      2</sup
    >, a searchable database of every project listed in the four major carbon
    registories:
    <a href="https://acrcarbon.org/">American Carbon Registry (ACR)</a>,
    <a href="https://www.climateactionreserve.org/"
      >Climate Action Reserve (CAR)</a
    >, <a href="https://www.goldstandard.org/">Gold Standard</a>, and
    <a href="https://verra.org/">Verra</a>
    <sup style="font-size: 10px;"> 3</sup>. These platforms make up the majority
    of the voluntary carbon market and record lists of various carbon offsetting
    projects, as well as the different methodologies that underlie them. The
    voluntary market is one of two distinct domains for carbon offsetting today
    and is open to the public to develop or purchase carbon offsetting products.
    The other domain is the mandatory or “compliance” marketplaces that form
    part of regulatory schemes run by governments and which are the basis for
    reaching international climate commitments. Despite high hopes at the most
    recent COP meeting in 2023 for regulation of voluntary carbon market, an
    agreement on key rules for carbon trading was not reached. Voluntary markets
    remain unregulated by the UN or governmental bodies.

    This archive is divided into two sections. The first lists all offset
    projects which are the various intiatives listed on registries to reduce or
    remove carbon. Each project has been approved by the registry where it is
    listed. The second dataset consists of offset sales data. This lists every
    entity that has bought carbon offsets from a registry.
